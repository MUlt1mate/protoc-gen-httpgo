#    - gosimple # specializes in simplifying a code
#    - govet # reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf calls whose arguments do not align with the format string
    - ineffassign # detects when assignments to existing variables are not used
#    - staticcheck # is a go vet on steroids, applying a ton of static analysis checks
    - typecheck # like the front-end of a Go compiler, parses and type-checks Go code
    - unused # checks for unused constants, variables, functions and types
    ## disabled by default
    - asasalint # checks for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any)

    - durationcheck # checks for two durations multiplied together
    - errname # checks that sentinel errors are prefixed with the Err and error types are suffixed with the Error

    - gomoddirectives # manages the use of 'replace', 'retract', and 'excludes' directives in go.mod
    - gomodguard # allow and block lists linter for direct Go module dependencies. This is different from depguard where there are different block types for example version constraints and module recommendations
    - goprintffuncname # checks that printf-like functions are named with f at the end
    - gosec # inspects source code for security problems
    - loggercheck # checks key value pairs for common logger libraries (kitlog,klog,logr,zap)
